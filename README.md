# Sales_Insights_PowerBI


This Project focusses on using Data from an OLTP Database and exporting the tables to Power BI to build our visualization dashboards.'
The first step in our project is to import our Datbase Tables into Power BI.
We then perform Data Filtering and Data Cleaning using Power BI's inbuilt ETL Pipeline.
We perform Data Transformation on a couple of data columns in our tables.
We perform filtering operations like removing null values, normalization of required columns etc. This is the Data Transformation process.
Once this process is completed we then begin to construct our Dashboards.
The Visualization process begins with selecting our base measures.
Now we can begin the construction of our charts based on business requirements.
